# Personal Website 
## Summary
This is an experimental personal website using the current state-of-the-art web3 technology with my web technologies knowledge of React.Js, TypeScript, and NodeJs. The homepage displays the website summary and requires a "login" via a wallet provider to view the contents. <br>
**Note: The current web3 technologies are not exactly user-friendly, to navigate the website you have to be technologically savvy!**
