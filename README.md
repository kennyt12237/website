## Assistance
### Unsupported Network
The Website currently supports using the Sepolia Network. When using an unsupported network, you will get the page with the error message below. <br><br>

#### Solution
click on the "Connect To Sepolica Testnet" Button. The Metamask Wallet Extension will pop up, and will prompt you to switch network. Press the "Switch Network" button. <br>
**Note: The website will reload, and pressing the "Connect Wallet" will now connect to the right network.** <br><br>
